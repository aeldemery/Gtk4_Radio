Gtk4 Radio is a WIP Internet Radio browsing application using Gtk4, but there is no garantee that it will be completed. I get to work on this in weekends and spare time.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

I wanted to give `libsoup-3.0` a try, so you have to compile it form [git source](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsoup). But it require as a dependecy a developmental branch of `glib` so you have to compile it as well.

Be aware however that you shouldn't install `libsoup` to `/usr` directory as it could crash `gnome-shell`. Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsoup/-/issues/208).
### Installing

It doesn't do anything usefull __yet__. So probably you don't want to.
